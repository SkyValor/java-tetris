# java-tetris

While I was learning how to code, before I went to study at the <A/C>, I usually practiced in my free time. This practice included programming known games. I believe mimicking finished projects is a great way to learn some "Do's and Don'ts" of the art. These works are for learning purposes only.

The MVP for this project was having a simple game of TETRIS working. Version 1 is complete. Next, and with the knowledge I have today, I can say that the code is a huge mess. The next updates I shall be giving will be on refactoring. Making the whole project cleaner and more organized.

I will also be making use of the libDGX library for this next step, as I believe is a huge help in making for better projects in JAVA.
